# Neural Network - XOR
**By Clara Rubio**  


### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crubsol/TP5_Neural_Network.git
   ```

2. **Open the project** in Unity (version 2022.3.4f1 or later recommended).

3. **Run the project** to start the simulation.



### Start the Simulation

1. **Open the scene** called "SampleScene".
   
2. **Click play** to start the simulation.
   
3. **Undertand the scene** The first line of cubes is the input, the second one is the expected output and the last one is the output of our NN

4. **Change the cube's color** Click them and they will turn to the other color (white is 0, black 1)

5. **Chanege the parameters** Go to the GameObject's inspector and see the diferents values you can change
   - Num entradas: number of inputs (cubes)
   - Num ocultas: number of hidden layers
   - Num salidas: number of outputs (sheres)
